What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?

I think my greatest talent would have to be probably my logical and creative thinking, I've always excelled at logic-based tasks and I am very good in math. Ever since I was a kid I spent a lot of time doing different puzzles and in elementary school I used to solve unreasonably complex equations to kill time. In middle school I attended a class with an emphasis on advanced math, even being one of the 4 people, who took even more advanced classes once weekly. Attending these classes helped me with improving my logical thinking, once even getting a piece of cake from the teacher for solving a problem she couldn't crack. During middle school we took an I-S-T 2000 R iq test, where I scored full points or 145+ in math. During high school I spent a lot of time studying math on my own, as the level of the classes was far behind of what I've already learnt years ago in middle school, giving me the ability to study more in depth in the areas in which I was more interested, namely statistics and probability. Now, in the last year of high school, I'm attending extra logic classes, which are sadly much more basic and don't pose any challenge whatsoever, as opposed to what I had expected and hoped for. I hope, when I'm at university, I will meet a challenge and can properly develop these talents to their full potential.
